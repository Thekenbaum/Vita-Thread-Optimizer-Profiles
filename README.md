# Vita-Thread-Optimizer-Profiles
A collection of thread optimizer profiles that either I made or I found on the web.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you made a profile yourself or made an enhancement to one of the profiles in this thread;
make sure to put it in the issues tab and label it as (Profile) or (Enhancement)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# How to Install
Make sure you have thread optimizer installed correctly by following this guide.

One that is done, simply select the profile you want and move the "ThreadOptimizer"
folder into your UX0:/Data folder on your vita.

# Additional Notes for certain profiles

# Jak and Daxter: The precursor Legacy (US Version) Profile by: Thekenbaum
This profile is meant to be combined with Vitagrafix to run the game at native resolution at 30fps.
This profile works pretty well as long as you overclock your vita to 444mhz.
Some lag is still present when picking power cells and some very minor graphical glitches happen
(Example: Jaks eyes dissapearing momentarly while flashing after taking damage,
though I don't know if this is the profile or just the shoddy port)
Overall the game runs WAY better with this profile than without it.

# Killzone Mercenearies (US Version) Profile by: Justalex
These two profiles were tested using 444mhz overclock and native resolution.
There are two different profiles included, one for higher fps with less lag, and the other for lower latency.
Select which profile you wish to use.

# Wipeout 2048 (US Version) Profile by: Justalex
These two profiles were tested using 444mhz overclock and native resolution.
Two profiles included, High intensity and Final. The Final profile increases the average FPS and is more consistant
while High Intencity boost FPS to as high as it can go while sacrificing some FPS consistancy (not much though).
Select which profile you wish to use.

# Gal*gun: Double Peace (US Version) Profile by: Thekenbaum
Profile was tested with 444mhz overclock.
The game runs a little better but unfortunately the games main bottle neak seems to be the graphics processor.
Don't expect this to work some miracles, but this is at least a little better.
